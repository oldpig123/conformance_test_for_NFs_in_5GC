Figure 7B.7.3-1 Authentication Procedure for AUN3 devices supporting 5G key hierarchy using EAP-AKA’
Steps 1-7 are the same as steps 1-7 in clause 7B.7.2. 
8. The UDM shall send to the AUSF a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message, including the EAP-AKA’ authentication vector (RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK´ and IK´), the SUPI. 
Steps 9-15 are the same as steps 9-15 in clause 7B.7.2. 
16. The AUSF shall verify the AKA’-Challenge message as described in RFC 5448[12]. If successful, the AUSF shall generate the KAUSF as defined in section 6.1.3.1.
17. The AUSF shall send to the AMF/SEAF an Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message including the EAP-Success, the Anchor key, and the SUPI. 
In the final authentication message from the home network, if the AUSF has sent the anchor key KSEAF, the SEAF shall derive the KAMF from KSEAF and send it to the AMF. 
18. The AMF shall derive KWAGF key. 
19. The AMF shall send EAP-Success and KWAGF to the 5G-RG in N1 message.
Step 19 could be NAS Security Mode Command or Authentication Result. If Step 19 is a NAS Security Mode Command, it uses NULL encryption and NULL integrity protection, since the NAS security context is not required in this scenario.
NOTE: 	Whether the key KWAGF is used by the 5G-RG and W-AGF is out of the scope of 3GPP. 
20. Step 20 is the same as step 19 in clause 7B.7.2. 
21a-21b. If the layer 2 connection is over WLAN (IEEE 802.11), the AUN3 device and the 5G-RG use KWAGF as the PMK, from which the WLAN keys are derived. 
22. Step 22 is the same as step 21 in clause 7B.7.2.
- Figure Z.2-1 Authentication Procedure for AUN3 devices by 5GC using key-generating EAP method
This authentication procedure is based on clause 7B.7.3 but differs in some steps. 
Steps 1-6 are the same as steps 1-6 in clause 7B.7.3. 
7.  Upon reception of the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, the UDM shall invoke the SIDF to map the SUCI to the SUPI and select an authentication method based on the SUPI and the AUN3 device indicator. When the "username" part of the SUPI is "anonymous" or omitted, the UDM may select an authentication method based on the “realm” part of the SUPI, the AUN3 device indicator, a combination of the "realm" part and the AUN3 device indicator, or the UDM local policy. When EAP-AKA´ authentication method is selected, the UDM/ARPF shall generate an authentication vector using the Access Network Identity as the KDF input parameter.
8. The UDM shall send to the AUSF a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message, including the SUPI and EAP-AKA’ authentication vector if EAP-AKA’ is selected or the selected authentication method if other key generating EAP method (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, etc) is selected. According to the AUN3 subscription data, the UDM shall also send the MSK indicator to AUSF.
9. The AUN3 device and the AUSF perform the selected EAP authentication method. 
Steps 10-15 are the same as steps 17-22 in clause 7B.7.3.
- EAP-AKA' is specified in RFC 5448 [12]. The 3GPP 5G profile for EAP-AKA' is specified in the normative Annex F.
The selection of using EAP-AKA' is described in sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document. 


Figure 6.1.3.1-1: Authentication procedure for EAP-AKA'
The authentication procedure for EAP-AKA' works as follows, cf. also Figure 6.1.3.1-1:
1.	The UDM/ARPF shall first generate an authentication vector with Authentication Management Field (AMF) separation bit = 1 as defined in TS 33.102 [9]. The UDM/ARPF shall then compute CK' and IK' as per the normative Annex A and replace CK and IK by CK' and IK'. 
2.	The UDM shall subsequently send this transformed authentication vector AV' (RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK', IK') to the AUSF from which it received the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request together with an indication that the AV' is to be used for EAP-AKA' using a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message. 
NOTE:	The exchange of a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message and an Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message between the AUSF and the UDM/ARPF described in the preceding paragraph is the same as for trusted access using EAP-AKA' described in TS 33.402 [11], sub-clause 6.2, step 10, except for the input parameter to the key derivation, which is the value of <network name>. The "network name" is a concept from RFC 5448 [12]; it is carried in the AT_KDF_INPUT attribute in EAP-AKA'. The value of <network name> parameter is not defined in RFC 5448 [12], but rather in 3GPP specifications. For EPS, it is defined as "access network identity" in TS 24.302 [71], and for 5G, it is defined as "serving network name" in sub-clause 6.1.1.4 of the present document.
In case SUCI was included in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, UDM will include the SUPI in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.
If a subscriber has an AKMA subscription, the UDM shall include the AKMA indication and Routing indicator in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.
3.	The AUSF shall send the EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the SEAF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. 
4.	The SEAF shall transparently forward the EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the UE in a NAS message Authentication Request message. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN received in EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the USIM. This message shall include the ngKSI and ABBA parameter. In fact, SEAF shall include the ngKSI and ABBA parameter in all EAP-Authentication request message. The ngKSI will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1. During an EAP authentication, the value of the ngKSI and the ABBA parameter sent by the SEAF to the UE shall not be changed.
NOTE 1: 	The SEAF needs to understand that the authentication method used is an EAP method by evaluating the type of authentication method based on the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. 
5.	At receipt of the RAND and AUTN, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the AV' by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in TS 33.102 [9]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. The USIM shall return RES, CK, IK to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e. GPRS Kc) from CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [9], and sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. The ME shall derive CK' and IK' according to Annex A.3.
	If the verification of the AUTN fails on the USIM, then the USIM and ME shall proceed as described in sub-clause 6.1.3. 3.
6.	The UE shall send the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message to the SEAF in a NAS message Auth-Resp message.
7.	The SEAF shall transparently forward the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message to the AUSF in Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. 
8.	The AUSF shall verify the message by comparing the XRES and RES, and if the AUSF has successfully verified this message it shall continue as follows, otherwise it shall return an error to the SEAF. AUSF shall inform UDM about the authentication result (see sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document for details on linking authentication confirmation). 
9.	The AUSF and the UE may exchange EAP-Request/AKA'-Notification and EAP-Response /AKA'-Notification messages via the SEAF. The SEAF shall transparently forward these messages. 
NOTE 2: 	EAP Notifications as described in RFC 3748 [27] and EAP-AKA Notifications as described in RFC 4187 [21] can be used at any time in the EAP-AKA exchange. These notifications can be used e.g. for protected result indications or when the EAP server detects an error in the received EAP-AKA response.  
10.	The AUSF derives EMSK from CK’ and IK’ as described in RFC 5448[12] and Annex F. The AUSF uses the most significant 256 bits of EMSK as the KAUSF and then calculates KSEAF from KAUSF as described in clause A.6. The AUSF shall send an EAP Success message to the SEAF inside Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response, which shall forward it transparently to the UE. Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message contains the KSEAF. If the AUSF received a SUCI from the SEAF when the authentication was initiated (see sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document), then the AUSF shall also include the SUPI in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. The AUSF stores the KAUSF based on the home network operator's policy according to clause 6.1.1.1.
NOTE 3: 	For lawful interception, the AUSF sending SUPI to SEAF is necessary but not sufficient. By including the SUPI as input parameter to the key derivation of KAMF from KSEAF, additional assurance on the correctness of SUPI is achieved by the serving network from both, home network and UE side. 
11.	The SEAF shall send the EAP Success message to the UE in the N1 message. This message shall also include the ngKSI and the ABBA parameter. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1.
NOTE 4: 	Step 11 could be NAS Security Mode Command or Authentication Result. 
NOTE 5: 	The ABBA parameter is included to enable the bidding down protection of security features that may be introduced later.  
The key received in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message shall become the anchor key, KSEAF in the sense of the key hierarchy in sub-clause 6.2 of the present document. The SEAF shall then derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7 and send it to the AMF. On receiving the EAP-Success message, the UE derives EMSK from CK’ and IK’ as described in RFC 5448 and Annex F. The ME uses the most significant 256 bits of the EMSK as the KAUSF and then calculates KSEAF in the same way as the AUSF. The UE shall derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7.
NOTE 6:	As an implementation option, the UE creates the temporary security context as described in step 11 after receiving the EAP message that allows EMSK to be calculated. The UE turns this temporary security context into a partial security context when it receives the EAP Success. The UE removes the temporary security context if the EAP authentication fails. 
The further steps taken by the AUSF upon receiving a successfully verified EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message are described in sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document. 
If the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message is not successfully verified, the subsequent AUSF behaviour is determined according to the home network's policy. 
If AUSF and SEAF determine that the authentication was successful, then the SEAF provides the ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF.
- 5G AKA enhances EPS AKA [10] by providing the home network with proof of successful authentication of the UE from the visited network. The proof is sent by the visited network in an Authentication Confirmation message. 
The selection of using 5G AKA is described in sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document. 
NOTE 1:	5G AKA does not support requesting multiple 5G AVs, neither the SEAF pre-fetching 5G AVs from the home network for future use.


Figure 6.1.3.2-1: Authentication procedure for 5G AKA
The authentication procedure for 5G AKA works as follows, cf. also Figure 6.1.3.2-1:
1.	For each Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, the UDM/ARPF shall create a 5G HE AV. The UDM/ARPF does this by generating an AV with the Authentication Management Field (AMF) separation bit set to "1" as defined in TS 33.102 [9]. The UDM/ARPF shall then derive KAUSF (as per Annex A.2) and calculate XRES* (as per Annex A.4). Finally, the UDM/ARPF shall create a 5G HE AV from RAND, AUTN, XRES*, and KAUSF.
2.	The UDM shall then return the 5G HE AV to the AUSF together with an indication that the 5G HE AV is to be used for 5G AKA in a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response. In case SUCI was included in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, UDM will include the SUPI in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response after deconcealment of SUCI by SIDF.
If a subscriber has an AKMA subscription, the UDM shall include the AKMA indication and Routing indicator in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.
3.	The AUSF shall store the XRES* temporarily together with the received SUCI or SUPI. 
4.	The AUSF shall then generate the 5G AV from the 5G HE AV received from the UDM/ARPF by computing the HXRES* from XRES* (according to Annex A.5) and KSEAF from KAUSF (according to Annex A.6), and replacing the XRES* with the HXRES* and KAUSF with KSEAF in the 5G HE AV.
5.	The AUSF shall then remove the KSEAF and return the 5G SE AV (RAND, AUTN, HXRES*) to the SEAF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response. 
6.	The SEAF shall send RAND, AUTN to the UE in a NAS message Authentication Request. This message shall also include the ngKSI that will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the KAMF and the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful. This message shall also include the ABBA parameter. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN received in NAS message Authentication Request to the USIM.
NOTE 2: The ABBA parameter is included to enable the bidding down protection of security features.
7.	At receipt of the RAND and AUTN, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the received values by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in TS 33.102[9]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. The USIM shall return RES, CK, IK to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e. GPRS Kc) from CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [9], and sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. The ME then shall compute RES* from RES according to Annex A.4. The ME shall calculate KAUSF from CK||IK according to clause A.2. The ME shall calculate KSEAF from KAUSF according to clause A.6. An ME accessing 5G shall check during authentication that the "separation bit" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 1. The "separation bit" is bit 0 of the AMF field of AUTN.
NOTE 3:	This separation bit in the AMF field of AUTN cannot be used anymore for operator specific purposes as described by TS 33.102 [9], Annex F.
8.	The UE shall return RES* to the SEAF in a NAS message Authentication Response. 
9.	The SEAF shall then compute HRES* from RES* according to Annex A.5, and the SEAF shall compare HRES* and HXRES*. If they coincide, the SEAF shall consider the authentication successful from the serving network point of view. If not, the SEAF proceed as described in sub-clause 6.1.3.2.2. If the UE is not reached, and the RES* is never received by the SEAF, the SEAF shall consider authentication as failed, and indicate a failure to the AUSF.
10.	The SEAF shall send RES*, as received from the UE, in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message to the AUSF.
11.	When the AUSF receives as authentication confirmation the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message including a RES* it may verify whether the 5G AV has expired. If the 5G AV has expired, the AUSF may consider the authentication as unsuccessful from the home network point of view. Upon successful authentication, the AUSF stores the KAUSF based on the home network operator's policy according to clause 6.1.1.1. AUSF shall compare the received RES* with the stored XRES*. If the RES* and XRES* are equal, the AUSF shall consider the authentication as successful from the home network point of view. AUSF shall inform UDM about the authentication result (see sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document for linking with the authentication confirmation).
NOTE 4: It is left to implementation to temporarily store the KAUSF received in step 2 in AUSF until the RES* verification is done successfully (i.e., at step 11).
12.	The AUSF shall indicate to the SEAF in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response whether the authentication was successful or not from the home network point of view. If the authentication was successful, the KSEAF shall be sent to the SEAF in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response. In case the AUSF received a SUCI from the SEAF in the authentication request (see sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document), and if the authentication was successful, then the AUSF shall also include the SUPI in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. 
If the authentication was successful, the key KSEAF received in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message shall become the anchor key in the sense of the key hierarchy as specified in sub-clause 6.2 of the present document. Then the SEAF shall derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7. The SEAF shall provide the ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. If the AUSF indicates that the authentication was successful from the home network point of view, then the AMF shall initiate NAS security mode command procedure (see clause 6.7.2) with the UE, to take the newly generated partial native 5G NAS security context into use. Upon receiving the valid NAS Security Mode Command message from the AMF, the UE shall consider the performed primary authentication as successful.
If a SUCI was used for this authentication, then the SEAF shall only provide ngKSI and KAMF to the AMF after it has received the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message containing KSEAF and SUPI; no communication services will be provided to the UE until the SUPI is known to the serving network.
The further steps taken by the AUSF after the authentication procedure are described in sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document.
- Figure O.3-1 shows the details of the authentication procedure as part of the initial registration procedure specified in clause 4.10a of TS 23.316 [79] following the principles listed in clause O.2. It uses EAP-TLS as an example, but other EAP methods can also be supported. The W-AGF acts on behalf of the N5GC device during the registration process. The link between the N5GC device and the RG, and between the RG and the W-AGF can be any data link (L2) that supports EAP encapsulation.


Figure O.3-1: Registration and authentication of a non-5G capable device to the 5GC

In the following, the procedure for registration and authentication of an N5GC device to the 5GC is described: 
1.  The N5GC device connects to the W-AGF via a RG which is configured as a layer 2 bridge. The W-AGF is associated with a 5GC and acts on behalf of the N5GC device during its registration process. 
2a. The W-AGF initiates the EAP authentication procedure by sending an EAP request/Identity to the N5GC device via the RG, which acts as an L2 bridge device and forwards the ethernet frame to the N5GC device. The EAP message is encapsualted inside an L2 frame (e.g., EAPOL). 
2b. In response, the N5GC device sends back an EAP response/Identity including its Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of username@realm.  
NOTE 1: If TLS subscription identifier privacy protection is supported , as in "Section 2.1.4. Privacy" of RFC 5216 [38] for TLS 1.2 or in RFC 8446 [60] for TLS 1.3, the "username" part must be is either omitted or "anonymous". 
3. The W-AGF creates a registration request on behalf of the N5GC device with an indication that the registration is on behalf of an N5GC device. The SUPI of the N5GC device is the NAI as received from the device, and the W-AGF constructs the SUCI from this SUPI using the NULL scheme.
4a. The W-AGF selects the AMF/SEAF.
4b. The W-AGF sends to the AMF/SEAF a registration request on behalf of the N5GC device. The registration request includes the NAI SUCI, wireline network name if available, and a device capability indicator (e.g., the device is non-5G capable). 
4c. The AMF/SEAF selects the AUSF based on the SUCI in the received registration request and sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message to the AUSF. It contains the SUCI of the N5GC device, and an indicator that the request is on behalf of the N5GC device. 
5a. The AUSF sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request to the UDM. It contains the SUCI of the N5GC device and the N5GC device indicator. 
5b. The UDM invokes the SIDF to map the SUCI to the SUPI and selects an authentication method, e.g., EAP-TLS, based on the SUPI. When the "username" part of the SUPI is "anonymous" or omitted, the UDM may select an authentication method based on the “realm” part of the SUPI, the N5GC device indicator, a combination of the "realm" part and the N5GC device indicator, or the UDM local policy. 
5c. The UDM sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response to the AUSF, which contains the SUPI of the N5GC device and an indicator of the selected authentication method, e.g., EAP-TLS. According to the N5GC device subscription data, the UDM shall also send the MSK indicator to the AUSF to indicate that the N5GC device does not support the 5G key hirerachy.
NOTE 2: Steps 6a-14c describe the exchange of EAP-TLS between the AUSF and the N5GC device, based on TLS 1.2 without subscription identifier privacy protection. If the operator determines to provide subscription identifier privacy for the N5GC in TLS layer, the EAP TLS server needs to support privacy either inherently (e.g., in TLS 1.3) or via separate privacy option (e.g., in TLS 1.2). When TLS 1.2 is used, the N5GC device would need to behave as described in "Section 2.1.4. Privacy" of RFC 5216 [38] where instead of sending the client certificate in cleartext over the air, the N5GC device sends TLS certificate (no cert) during the first TLS handshake and sends TLS certificate (client certificate) during the second TLS handshake within the TLS session negotiated form the first TLS handshake.
6a.  The AUSF starts EAP-TLS by sending to the AMF/SEAF a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message containing an EAP-Request message of EAP-type=EAP-TLS with the Start (S) bit set, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start].
6b.	The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] in the Authentication Request message to the W-AGF. 
6c. After receiving the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message from AMF/SEAF, the W-AGF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message to the N5GC device in an L2 message, leaving out the ABBA and ngKSI parameters. 
7a. After receiving the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message from the W-AGF, the N5GC device replies to the W-AGF with an EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message whose data field encapsulates a TLS client_hello message. Such EAP-Response message, denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello], is encapsulated in an L2 message. 
7b.	The W-AGF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello] to the AMF/SEAF in an Authentication Response message. 
7c.	The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. 
8a.	The AUSF replies to the AMF/SEAF with EAP-Request/EAP-TLS message whose data field encapsulates a TLS server_hello message, a TLS server certificate message, a TLS server_key_exchange message, a TLS client certificate_request message, and a TLS server_hello_done message. Such EAP-Request message, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello], is encapsulated in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. 
8b.	The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] message to the W-AGF in an Authentication Request message. 
8c. The W-AGF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] to the N5GC device in an L2 message. 
9.	The N5GC device authenticates the AUSF by validating the server certificate included in the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] message received in step 8c. The N5GC device needs to be provisioned with certificates of a trust anchor to validate the AUSF server certificate. In addition, the N5GC device also needs to be provisioned with its own client certificate. 
10a. If the TLS server authentication is successful, then the N5GC device replies to the W-AGF with EAP-Response/EAP-TLS in an L2 message. The data field of the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message contains a TLS client certificate message, a TLS client_key_exchange message, a TLS certificate_verify message, a TLS change_cipher_spec message, and TLS finished message. This EAP-Response message is denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate]. 
10b. The W-AGF forwards to the AMF/SEAF the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] in an Authentication Response message. 
10c. The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. 
11.	The AUSF authenticates the N5GC device by verifying the client certificate received in the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] message. Among other validations, the AUSF verifies that the client certificate is issued by a certificate authority trusted by the AUSF. If the client certificate is verified successfully, the AUSF continues to step 12a. Otherwise the AUSF returns an EAP-failure message. The AUSF needs to be provisioned with certificates of trust anchor to verify client certificates. 
12a. The AUSF sends to the AMF/SEAF an EAP-Request/EAP-TLS message with its data field encapsulating a TLS change_cipher_spec message and a TLS server finished. This EAP-Request message, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished], is encapsulated in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message.
12b. The AMF/SEAF forwards EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished] message to the W-AGF in an Authentication Request message. 
12c. The W-AGF forwards EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished] message to the N5GC device in an L2 message.
13a. The N5GC sends to the W-AGF an EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message with its data field set to empty, denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty], in an L2 message
13b. The W-AGF forwards to the AMF/SEAF the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty] message in an Authentication Response message. 
13c. The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. 
14a. The AUSF sends to the AMF/SEAF an EAP-Success message and the MSK along with the SUPI in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. If the SUPI received from the UDM in step 5c is anonymous, the AUSF derives the SUPI from the client identifier in the TLS client certificate. AUSF does not perform the derivation of KAUSF nor KSEAF based on the MSK indicator received in step 5c.  
NOTE 2a:	It is left to implementation if the AUSF verifies that the SUPI derived from the client certificate belongs to a valid susbcription in the network and returns an EAP-failure message if there is a miss-match.
14b. The AMF/SEAF forwards to the W-AGF the EAP-Success message and the MSK in an Authentication Result message or a Security Mode Command message. 
14c. The W-AGF forwards to the N5GC device the EAP-Success message in an L2 message, and the authentication procedure is finished. 
NOTE 3:	Neither the AUSF nor the N5GC device performs further 5G related key derivation from EMSK, since neither 5G AS nor 5G NAS security is used in this setting. 
15. The AUSF sends a UDM_Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message to the UDM, including the SUPI obtained from the TLS client certificate, SN-name, the authentication method (i.e., EAP-TLS), the authentication result, and a timestamp. 
16. The UDM stores the authentication result accordingly. 
17. The UDM sends a UDM_Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Response message to the AUSF. 
18. The AMF sends a Nudm_UEContextManagement_Registration Request message to the UDM. 
19. The UDM authorizes the registration request based on authentication result stored in step 16 and other information (e.g., UE subscription profile). 
20. The UDM sends a Nudm_UEContextManagement_Registration Response message to the AMF.

  "This clause specifies the how an AUN3 device supporting 5G key hierarchy behind 5G-RG shall be registered to the 5GC by the 5G-RG and shall be authenticated by 5GC using EAP-AKA’.\n\n\n\nFigure 7B.7.3-1 Authentication Procedure for AUN3 devices supporting 5G key hierarchy using EAP-AKA’\nSteps 1-7 are the same as steps 1-7 in clause 7B.7.2. \n8. The UDM shall send to the AUSF a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message, including the EAP-AKA’ authentication vector (RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK´ and IK´), the SUPI. \nSteps 9-15 are the same as steps 9-15 in clause 7B.7.2. \n16. The AUSF shall verify the AKA’-Challenge message as described in RFC 5448[12]. If successful, the AUSF shall generate the KAUSF as defined in section 6.1.3.1.\n17. The AUSF shall send to the AMF/SEAF an Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message including the EAP-Success, the Anchor key, and the SUPI. \nIn the final authentication message from the home network, if the AUSF has sent the anchor key KSEAF, the SEAF shall derive the KAMF from KSEAF and send it to the AMF. \n18. The AMF shall derive KWAGF key. \n19. The AMF shall send EAP-Success and KWAGF to the 5G-RG in N1 message.\nStep 19 could be NAS Security Mode Command or Authentication Result. If Step 19 is a NAS Security Mode Command, it uses NULL encryption and NULL integrity protection, since the NAS security context is not required in this scenario.\nNOTE: \tWhether the key KWAGF is used by the 5G-RG and W-AGF is out of the scope of 3GPP. \n20. Step 20 is the same as step 19 in clause 7B.7.2. \n21a-21b. If the layer 2 connection is over WLAN (IEEE 802.11), the AUN3 device and the 5G-RG use KWAGF as the PMK, from which the WLAN keys are derived. \n22. Step 22 is the same as step 21 in clause 7B.7.2.",
  "Figure Z.2-1 Authentication Procedure for AUN3 devices by 5GC using key-generating EAP method\nThis authentication procedure is based on clause 7B.7.3 but differs in some steps. \nSteps 1-6 are the same as steps 1-6 in clause 7B.7.3. \n7.  Upon reception of the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, the UDM shall invoke the SIDF to map the SUCI to the SUPI and select an authentication method based on the SUPI and the AUN3 device indicator. When the \"username\" part of the SUPI is \"anonymous\" or omitted, the UDM may select an authentication method based on the “realm” part of the SUPI, the AUN3 device indicator, a combination of the \"realm\" part and the AUN3 device indicator, or the UDM local policy. When EAP-AKA´ authentication method is selected, the UDM/ARPF shall generate an authentication vector using the Access Network Identity as the KDF input parameter.\n8. The UDM shall send to the AUSF a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message, including the SUPI and EAP-AKA’ authentication vector if EAP-AKA’ is selected or the selected authentication method if other key generating EAP method (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, etc) is selected. According to the AUN3 subscription data, the UDM shall also send the MSK indicator to AUSF.\n9. The AUN3 device and the AUSF perform the selected EAP authentication method. \nSteps 10-15 are the same as steps 17-22 in clause 7B.7.3.",
  "EAP-AKA' is specified in RFC 5448 [12]. The 3GPP 5G profile for EAP-AKA' is specified in the normative Annex F.\nThe selection of using EAP-AKA' is described in sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document. \n\n\nFigure 6.1.3.1-1: Authentication procedure for EAP-AKA'\nThe authentication procedure for EAP-AKA' works as follows, cf. also Figure 6.1.3.1-1:\n1.\tThe UDM/ARPF shall first generate an authentication vector with Authentication Management Field (AMF) separation bit = 1 as defined in TS 33.102 [9]. The UDM/ARPF shall then compute CK' and IK' as per the normative Annex A and replace CK and IK by CK' and IK'. \n2.\tThe UDM shall subsequently send this transformed authentication vector AV' (RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK', IK') to the AUSF from which it received the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request together with an indication that the AV' is to be used for EAP-AKA' using a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message. \nNOTE:\tThe exchange of a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message and an Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message between the AUSF and the UDM/ARPF described in the preceding paragraph is the same as for trusted access using EAP-AKA' described in TS 33.402 [11], sub-clause 6.2, step 10, except for the input parameter to the key derivation, which is the value of <network name>. The \"network name\" is a concept from RFC 5448 [12]; it is carried in the AT_KDF_INPUT attribute in EAP-AKA'. The value of <network name> parameter is not defined in RFC 5448 [12], but rather in 3GPP specifications. For EPS, it is defined as \"access network identity\" in TS 24.302 [71], and for 5G, it is defined as \"serving network name\" in sub-clause 6.1.1.4 of the present document.\nIn case SUCI was included in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, UDM will include the SUPI in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.\nIf a subscriber has an AKMA subscription, the UDM shall include the AKMA indication and Routing indicator in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.\n3.\tThe AUSF shall send the EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the SEAF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. \n4.\tThe SEAF shall transparently forward the EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the UE in a NAS message Authentication Request message. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN received in EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the USIM. This message shall include the ngKSI and ABBA parameter. In fact, SEAF shall include the ngKSI and ABBA parameter in all EAP-Authentication request message. The ngKSI will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1. During an EAP authentication, the value of the ngKSI and the ABBA parameter sent by the SEAF to the UE shall not be changed.\nNOTE 1: \tThe SEAF needs to understand that the authentication method used is an EAP method by evaluating the type of authentication method based on the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. \n5.\tAt receipt of the RAND and AUTN, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the AV' by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in TS 33.102 [9]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. The USIM shall return RES, CK, IK to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e. GPRS Kc) from CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [9], and sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. The ME shall derive CK' and IK' according to Annex A.3.\n\tIf the verification of the AUTN fails on the USIM, then the USIM and ME shall proceed as described in sub-clause 6.1.3. 3.\n6.\tThe UE shall send the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message to the SEAF in a NAS message Auth-Resp message.\n7.\tThe SEAF shall transparently forward the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message to the AUSF in Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. \n8.\tThe AUSF shall verify the message by comparing the XRES and RES, and if the AUSF has successfully verified this message it shall continue as follows, otherwise it shall return an error to the SEAF. AUSF shall inform UDM about the authentication result (see sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document for details on linking authentication confirmation). \n9.\tThe AUSF and the UE may exchange EAP-Request/AKA'-Notification and EAP-Response /AKA'-Notification messages via the SEAF. The SEAF shall transparently forward these messages. \nNOTE 2: \tEAP Notifications as described in RFC 3748 [27] and EAP-AKA Notifications as described in RFC 4187 [21] can be used at any time in the EAP-AKA exchange. These notifications can be used e.g. for protected result indications or when the EAP server detects an error in the received EAP-AKA response.  \n10.\tThe AUSF derives EMSK from CK’ and IK’ as described in RFC 5448[12] and Annex F. The AUSF uses the most significant 256 bits of EMSK as the KAUSF and then calculates KSEAF from KAUSF as described in clause A.6. The AUSF shall send an EAP Success message to the SEAF inside Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response, which shall forward it transparently to the UE. Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message contains the KSEAF. If the AUSF received a SUCI from the SEAF when the authentication was initiated (see sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document), then the AUSF shall also include the SUPI in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. The AUSF stores the KAUSF based on the home network operator's policy according to clause 6.1.1.1.\nNOTE 3: \tFor lawful interception, the AUSF sending SUPI to SEAF is necessary but not sufficient. By including the SUPI as input parameter to the key derivation of KAMF from KSEAF, additional assurance on the correctness of SUPI is achieved by the serving network from both, home network and UE side. \n11.\tThe SEAF shall send the EAP Success message to the UE in the N1 message. This message shall also include the ngKSI and the ABBA parameter. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1.\nNOTE 4: \tStep 11 could be NAS Security Mode Command or Authentication Result. \nNOTE 5: \tThe ABBA parameter is included to enable the bidding down protection of security features that may be introduced later.  \nThe key received in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message shall become the anchor key, KSEAF in the sense of the key hierarchy in sub-clause 6.2 of the present document. The SEAF shall then derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7 and send it to the AMF. On receiving the EAP-Success message, the UE derives EMSK from CK’ and IK’ as described in RFC 5448 and Annex F. The ME uses the most significant 256 bits of the EMSK as the KAUSF and then calculates KSEAF in the same way as the AUSF. The UE shall derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7.\nNOTE 6:\tAs an implementation option, the UE creates the temporary security context as described in step 11 after receiving the EAP message that allows EMSK to be calculated. The UE turns this temporary security context into a partial security context when it receives the EAP Success. The UE removes the temporary security context if the EAP authentication fails. \nThe further steps taken by the AUSF upon receiving a successfully verified EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message are described in sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document. \nIf the EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message is not successfully verified, the subsequent AUSF behaviour is determined according to the home network's policy. \nIf AUSF and SEAF determine that the authentication was successful, then the SEAF provides the ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF.",
  "5G AKA enhances EPS AKA [10] by providing the home network with proof of successful authentication of the UE from the visited network. The proof is sent by the visited network in an Authentication Confirmation message. \nThe selection of using 5G AKA is described in sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document. \nNOTE 1:\t5G AKA does not support requesting multiple 5G AVs, neither the SEAF pre-fetching 5G AVs from the home network for future use.\n\n\nFigure 6.1.3.2-1: Authentication procedure for 5G AKA\nThe authentication procedure for 5G AKA works as follows, cf. also Figure 6.1.3.2-1:\n1.\tFor each Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, the UDM/ARPF shall create a 5G HE AV. The UDM/ARPF does this by generating an AV with the Authentication Management Field (AMF) separation bit set to \"1\" as defined in TS 33.102 [9]. The UDM/ARPF shall then derive KAUSF (as per Annex A.2) and calculate XRES* (as per Annex A.4). Finally, the UDM/ARPF shall create a 5G HE AV from RAND, AUTN, XRES*, and KAUSF.\n2.\tThe UDM shall then return the 5G HE AV to the AUSF together with an indication that the 5G HE AV is to be used for 5G AKA in a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response. In case SUCI was included in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request, UDM will include the SUPI in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response after deconcealment of SUCI by SIDF.\nIf a subscriber has an AKMA subscription, the UDM shall include the AKMA indication and Routing indicator in the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response.\n3.\tThe AUSF shall store the XRES* temporarily together with the received SUCI or SUPI. \n4.\tThe AUSF shall then generate the 5G AV from the 5G HE AV received from the UDM/ARPF by computing the HXRES* from XRES* (according to Annex A.5) and KSEAF from KAUSF (according to Annex A.6), and replacing the XRES* with the HXRES* and KAUSF with KSEAF in the 5G HE AV.\n5.\tThe AUSF shall then remove the KSEAF and return the 5G SE AV (RAND, AUTN, HXRES*) to the SEAF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response. \n6.\tThe SEAF shall send RAND, AUTN to the UE in a NAS message Authentication Request. This message shall also include the ngKSI that will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the KAMF and the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful. This message shall also include the ABBA parameter. The SEAF shall set the ABBA parameter as defined in Annex A.7.1. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN received in NAS message Authentication Request to the USIM.\nNOTE 2: The ABBA parameter is included to enable the bidding down protection of security features.\n7.\tAt receipt of the RAND and AUTN, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the received values by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in TS 33.102[9]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. The USIM shall return RES, CK, IK to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e. GPRS Kc) from CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [9], and sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. The ME then shall compute RES* from RES according to Annex A.4. The ME shall calculate KAUSF from CK||IK according to clause A.2. The ME shall calculate KSEAF from KAUSF according to clause A.6. An ME accessing 5G shall check during authentication that the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 1. The \"separation bit\" is bit 0 of the AMF field of AUTN.\nNOTE 3:\tThis separation bit in the AMF field of AUTN cannot be used anymore for operator specific purposes as described by TS 33.102 [9], Annex F.\n8.\tThe UE shall return RES* to the SEAF in a NAS message Authentication Response. \n9.\tThe SEAF shall then compute HRES* from RES* according to Annex A.5, and the SEAF shall compare HRES* and HXRES*. If they coincide, the SEAF shall consider the authentication successful from the serving network point of view. If not, the SEAF proceed as described in sub-clause 6.1.3.2.2. If the UE is not reached, and the RES* is never received by the SEAF, the SEAF shall consider authentication as failed, and indicate a failure to the AUSF.\n10.\tThe SEAF shall send RES*, as received from the UE, in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message to the AUSF.\n11.\tWhen the AUSF receives as authentication confirmation the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message including a RES* it may verify whether the 5G AV has expired. If the 5G AV has expired, the AUSF may consider the authentication as unsuccessful from the home network point of view. Upon successful authentication, the AUSF stores the KAUSF based on the home network operator's policy according to clause 6.1.1.1. AUSF shall compare the received RES* with the stored XRES*. If the RES* and XRES* are equal, the AUSF shall consider the authentication as successful from the home network point of view. AUSF shall inform UDM about the authentication result (see sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document for linking with the authentication confirmation).\nNOTE 4: It is left to implementation to temporarily store the KAUSF received in step 2 in AUSF until the RES* verification is done successfully (i.e., at step 11).\n12.\tThe AUSF shall indicate to the SEAF in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response whether the authentication was successful or not from the home network point of view. If the authentication was successful, the KSEAF shall be sent to the SEAF in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response. In case the AUSF received a SUCI from the SEAF in the authentication request (see sub-clause 6.1.2 of the present document), and if the authentication was successful, then the AUSF shall also include the SUPI in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. \nIf the authentication was successful, the key KSEAF received in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message shall become the anchor key in the sense of the key hierarchy as specified in sub-clause 6.2 of the present document. Then the SEAF shall derive the KAMF from the KSEAF, the ABBA parameter and the SUPI according to Annex A.7. The SEAF shall provide the ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. If the AUSF indicates that the authentication was successful from the home network point of view, then the AMF shall initiate NAS security mode command procedure (see clause 6.7.2) with the UE, to take the newly generated partial native 5G NAS security context into use. Upon receiving the valid NAS Security Mode Command message from the AMF, the UE shall consider the performed primary authentication as successful.\nIf a SUCI was used for this authentication, then the SEAF shall only provide ngKSI and KAMF to the AMF after it has received the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message containing KSEAF and SUPI; no communication services will be provided to the UE until the SUPI is known to the serving network.\nThe further steps taken by the AUSF after the authentication procedure are described in sub-clause 6.1.4 of the present document.",
  "Figure O.3-1 shows the details of the authentication procedure as part of the initial registration procedure specified in clause 4.10a of TS 23.316 [79] following the principles listed in clause O.2. It uses EAP-TLS as an example, but other EAP methods can also be supported. The W-AGF acts on behalf of the N5GC device during the registration process. The link between the N5GC device and the RG, and between the RG and the W-AGF can be any data link (L2) that supports EAP encapsulation.\n\n\nFigure O.3-1: Registration and authentication of a non-5G capable device to the 5GC\n\nIn the following, the procedure for registration and authentication of an N5GC device to the 5GC is described: \n1.  The N5GC device connects to the W-AGF via a RG which is configured as a layer 2 bridge. The W-AGF is associated with a 5GC and acts on behalf of the N5GC device during its registration process. \n2a. The W-AGF initiates the EAP authentication procedure by sending an EAP request/Identity to the N5GC device via the RG, which acts as an L2 bridge device and forwards the ethernet frame to the N5GC device. The EAP message is encapsualted inside an L2 frame (e.g., EAPOL). \n2b. In response, the N5GC device sends back an EAP response/Identity including its Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of username@realm.  \nNOTE 1: If TLS subscription identifier privacy protection is supported , as in \"Section 2.1.4. Privacy\" of RFC 5216 [38] for TLS 1.2 or in RFC 8446 [60] for TLS 1.3, the \"username\" part must be is either omitted or \"anonymous\". \n3. The W-AGF creates a registration request on behalf of the N5GC device with an indication that the registration is on behalf of an N5GC device. The SUPI of the N5GC device is the NAI as received from the device, and the W-AGF constructs the SUCI from this SUPI using the NULL scheme.\n4a. The W-AGF selects the AMF/SEAF.\n4b. The W-AGF sends to the AMF/SEAF a registration request on behalf of the N5GC device. The registration request includes the NAI SUCI, wireline network name if available, and a device capability indicator (e.g., the device is non-5G capable). \n4c. The AMF/SEAF selects the AUSF based on the SUCI in the received registration request and sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message to the AUSF. It contains the SUCI of the N5GC device, and an indicator that the request is on behalf of the N5GC device. \n5a. The AUSF sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request to the UDM. It contains the SUCI of the N5GC device and the N5GC device indicator. \n5b. The UDM invokes the SIDF to map the SUCI to the SUPI and selects an authentication method, e.g., EAP-TLS, based on the SUPI. When the \"username\" part of the SUPI is \"anonymous\" or omitted, the UDM may select an authentication method based on the “realm” part of the SUPI, the N5GC device indicator, a combination of the \"realm\" part and the N5GC device indicator, or the UDM local policy. \n5c. The UDM sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response to the AUSF, which contains the SUPI of the N5GC device and an indicator of the selected authentication method, e.g., EAP-TLS. According to the N5GC device subscription data, the UDM shall also send the MSK indicator to the AUSF to indicate that the N5GC device does not support the 5G key hirerachy.\nNOTE 2: Steps 6a-14c describe the exchange of EAP-TLS between the AUSF and the N5GC device, based on TLS 1.2 without subscription identifier privacy protection. If the operator determines to provide subscription identifier privacy for the N5GC in TLS layer, the EAP TLS server needs to support privacy either inherently (e.g., in TLS 1.3) or via separate privacy option (e.g., in TLS 1.2). When TLS 1.2 is used, the N5GC device would need to behave as described in \"Section 2.1.4. Privacy\" of RFC 5216 [38] where instead of sending the client certificate in cleartext over the air, the N5GC device sends TLS certificate (no cert) during the first TLS handshake and sends TLS certificate (client certificate) during the second TLS handshake within the TLS session negotiated form the first TLS handshake.\n6a.  The AUSF starts EAP-TLS by sending to the AMF/SEAF a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message containing an EAP-Request message of EAP-type=EAP-TLS with the Start (S) bit set, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start].\n6b.\tThe AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] in the Authentication Request message to the W-AGF. \n6c. After receiving the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message from AMF/SEAF, the W-AGF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message to the N5GC device in an L2 message, leaving out the ABBA and ngKSI parameters. \n7a. After receiving the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [TLS start] message from the W-AGF, the N5GC device replies to the W-AGF with an EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message whose data field encapsulates a TLS client_hello message. Such EAP-Response message, denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello], is encapsulated in an L2 message. \n7b.\tThe W-AGF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello] to the AMF/SEAF in an Authentication Response message. \n7c.\tThe AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_hello] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. \n8a.\tThe AUSF replies to the AMF/SEAF with EAP-Request/EAP-TLS message whose data field encapsulates a TLS server_hello message, a TLS server certificate message, a TLS server_key_exchange message, a TLS client certificate_request message, and a TLS server_hello_done message. Such EAP-Request message, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello], is encapsulated in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. \n8b.\tThe AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] message to the W-AGF in an Authentication Request message. \n8c. The W-AGF forwards the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] to the N5GC device in an L2 message. \n9.\tThe N5GC device authenticates the AUSF by validating the server certificate included in the EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_hello] message received in step 8c. The N5GC device needs to be provisioned with certificates of a trust anchor to validate the AUSF server certificate. In addition, the N5GC device also needs to be provisioned with its own client certificate. \n10a. If the TLS server authentication is successful, then the N5GC device replies to the W-AGF with EAP-Response/EAP-TLS in an L2 message. The data field of the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message contains a TLS client certificate message, a TLS client_key_exchange message, a TLS certificate_verify message, a TLS change_cipher_spec message, and TLS finished message. This EAP-Response message is denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate]. \n10b. The W-AGF forwards to the AMF/SEAF the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] in an Authentication Response message. \n10c. The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. \n11.\tThe AUSF authenticates the N5GC device by verifying the client certificate received in the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [client_certificate] message. Among other validations, the AUSF verifies that the client certificate is issued by a certificate authority trusted by the AUSF. If the client certificate is verified successfully, the AUSF continues to step 12a. Otherwise the AUSF returns an EAP-failure message. The AUSF needs to be provisioned with certificates of trust anchor to verify client certificates. \n12a. The AUSF sends to the AMF/SEAF an EAP-Request/EAP-TLS message with its data field encapsulating a TLS change_cipher_spec message and a TLS server finished. This EAP-Request message, denoted as EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished], is encapsulated in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message.\n12b. The AMF/SEAF forwards EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished] message to the W-AGF in an Authentication Request message. \n12c. The W-AGF forwards EAP-Request/EAP-TLS [server_finished] message to the N5GC device in an L2 message.\n13a. The N5GC sends to the W-AGF an EAP-Response/EAP-TLS message with its data field set to empty, denoted as EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty], in an L2 message\n13b. The W-AGF forwards to the AMF/SEAF the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty] message in an Authentication Response message. \n13c. The AMF/SEAF forwards the EAP-Response/EAP-TLS [empty] message to the AUSF in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message. \n14a. The AUSF sends to the AMF/SEAF an EAP-Success message and the MSK along with the SUPI in a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message. If the SUPI received from the UDM in step 5c is anonymous, the AUSF derives the SUPI from the client identifier in the TLS client certificate. AUSF does not perform the derivation of KAUSF nor KSEAF based on the MSK indicator received in step 5c.  \nNOTE 2a:\tIt is left to implementation if the AUSF verifies that the SUPI derived from the client certificate belongs to a valid susbcription in the network and returns an EAP-failure message if there is a miss-match.\n14b. The AMF/SEAF forwards to the W-AGF the EAP-Success message and the MSK in an Authentication Result message or a Security Mode Command message. \n14c. The W-AGF forwards to the N5GC device the EAP-Success message in an L2 message, and the authentication procedure is finished. \nNOTE 3:\tNeither the AUSF nor the N5GC device performs further 5G related key derivation from EMSK, since neither 5G AS nor 5G NAS security is used in this setting. \n15. The AUSF sends a UDM_Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message to the UDM, including the SUPI obtained from the TLS client certificate, SN-name, the authentication method (i.e., EAP-TLS), the authentication result, and a timestamp. \n16. The UDM stores the authentication result accordingly. \n17. The UDM sends a UDM_Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Response message to the AUSF. \n18. The AMF sends a Nudm_UEContextManagement_Registration Request message to the UDM. \n19.
